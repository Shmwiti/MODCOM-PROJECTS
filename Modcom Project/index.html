      <p>The Spanish omelet isn¬¥t just one of the most famous spanish main dishes you will find , but also one of the easiest. It¬¥s one of those plates almost everyone in Spain loves‚Ä¶ If you ever find someone from the country. who doesn¬¥t like it, you better don¬¥t trust them.</p>

      <img src="fabadaaustriana.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="80%">
      <p>Although we must admit it isn¬¥t the easiest of the Spanish main meals, the time and dedication put into it will be totally worth it.

      The fabada is a type of stew that usually includes beans (huge ones), chorizo, tocino (pork belly) and morcilla, just by hearing the names of the ingredients, one can tell it is a heavy dish. This dish is typical from an area in the north of Spain called Asturias, and historically it has been used many times during winter days, so your body stays warmer.    </p>

      <img src="grandmasclassicspanishmeatballs.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="80%">
      <p>One of those dishes, grandmas in Spain have always made, and kids love. Spanish meatballs are super simple to make, and they are perfect if you are having a party or people coming over.

      The albondigas, are eaten many times as tapas, but we had to include them as a main course‚Ä¶ You know how grandmas always make as much food as possible and then they force you to eat it all, right? Well, that happens with Albondigas every time you go to their house. They make 100 of them and you must eat them‚Ä¶ of course you always end up full! One of those traditional Spanish main courses you must try‚Ä¶

      <h3>üçó Pollo al ajillo</h3>
      <img src="polloalaljillo.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="80%">
      <p>Garlic chicken is also an important Spanish main course and although it originally comes from Andalusia, now a days it is eaten all over the country. The Pollo al ajillo has hundreds of recipes, as it doesn¬¥t just change depending on the region, but also on the family!

      Anyway, there are two things that of course everyone shares in their recipes, the chicken, and the garlic. Our best tip for this recipe, is to try to do it by yourself without even looking at other recipes and exploring different ways of making it. You will have fun and you will probably come up with really good ideas. </p>

      <h3>ü•ñ Spanish migas</h3>
      <img src="spanishmigas.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="80%">
      <p>Even though when you first look at the migas, they seem like a simple dish, they are actually pretty heavy. The recipe changes a lot depending in the region, other than the bread and the pork fat, they each add some extra ingredients, sometimes eggs, other times cucumbers and olives, even chorizo in some of them‚Ä¶

      The best thing about migas, is that you get to use the leftovers from different days, that way you won¬¥t have to go shopping again and go straight to the cooking part. The most famous migas you will see are from Arag√≥n, Andaluc√≠a, and La Mancha.</p>

      <p>We are sure we weren¬¥t the only ones, who as kids would dunk the bread every time there were soups, sometimes to the point where the whole soup (and bread) were ruined. Well, let us tell you something, that is one of the most important things about Castilian soup!

      This Spanish main dish is made of simple ingredients, such as eggs, bread, paprika‚Ä¶ But the whole combination done in the right way, ends up in a must try dish! It is also very easy to make, so you will sure be able to do it at home!</p>

      <img src="cocidomadrileno.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="80%">
      <p>In this spanish main dishes list, we had to include of course the famous cocido madrile√±o. It isn¬¥t like any other stew, this one includes all kind of meat, noodles and of course chickpeas.

      If you ever have the chance of visiting Madrid, we totally advice you to go to one of the restaurants in the center and try it, but do bring someone with you, because if you don¬¥t, you won¬¥t be able to even finish the dish. It is for sure one of the heaviest meals you will ever try‚Ä¶ But so good!</p>

      <p>Of course, ranking 1st in this typical spanish main courses list, you will find the paella. There is nothing like eating a paella while admiring the ocean in Valencia. At this point, we guess everyone knows or have hear about paella, but if it is your first time, you should know one thing, this is the type of food you must try at least once in your life.

      There are many types of paella and they change depending on the ingredients, some of them are made with fish, others with rabbit or chicken‚Ä¶ But all of them are delicious!</p>

      <img src="spanishspinachandchickpeas.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="80%">
      <p>Don¬¥t worry if you are vegetarian and you aren¬¥t seeing much food you could try in Spain, because this one is for you! For those who can¬¥t or don¬¥t want to eat cocido, this one could be the perfect alternative, it isn¬¥t so heavy, but still will do its job as a main course.

      This traditional dish from Seville (in the south of Spain), isn¬¥t just delicious, but also healthy and easy to make. By the way, if you are vegetarian, hold on, because we have more dishes coming your way.

            <h4>PATATAS BRAVAS WITH SMOKY ROMESCO SAUCE AND GARLIC AIOLI.</h4>
            <h5><b>A Vegan's favourite...</b><i>Proof that Spanish cuisine isn't all about the meat.</i></h5>
            <p>Potato. Cookbook: Patatas bravas. Media: Patatas bravas. Patatas bravas ( Spanish: [paÀàtatas Ààb…æaŒ≤as] ), also called patatas a la brava or papas bravas, all meaning "spicy potatoes", is a dish native to Spain.
            Course: Appetizer
            It typically consists of white potatoes that have been cut into 2-centimeter (0.79 in)-wide cubes, then fried in oil and served warm with a spicy sauce. This dish is commonly served in restaurants and bars in Madrid, and throughout Spain as part of tapas. 
            Whether you're in Madrid or Manchester, you'll have to look really hard to find a tapas bar that doesn't serve some version of these potatoes. They're beautiful fried simply with herbs and a pinch of salt, but even more exciting served in a spicy tomato 'bravas' sauce.</p>

        <h6>Recipe Video</h6>
        <p>In this video I present my patatas bravas recipe. 

          I have travelled all over spain and eaten lots of bravas in my time, and there can be many bars that serve extremely underwhelming versions, and some places that are absolutely wonderful. To me it all comes down to the cooking (and selection) of the potato, combined with the right sauce (and to me the bravas sauce should be spicy, and not just some mayonnaise mix).

          So I have taken everything I have learned over the years, and all that sampling, and created a recipe that is the best of best (hopefully) ;)</p>
